==================================

⚠️ this is experimental and not meant to be used in any production systems ⚠️

You must use Python 3 to use pip

# usage

`python src/pip install <package-name>`

will print out

```
/local/filesystem/install/path/foo.py
/local/filesystem/install/path/bar.py
...
```
